## Third-Part Libraries
I used two third-part libraries in this project:

* OkHttp3 - Open Source Http Client to make GET requests more efficiently and secure. (http://square.github.io/okhttp/)
* Picasso - Open Source library to handle download and caching mechanism for images and image view recycling. (http://square.github.io/picasso/)
